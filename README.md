# JAVA WEBAPPLICATION BASE
Az example setup to kickstart building a java webapplication

## DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS
### Frontend
When developing the frontend, it comes in handy if the application can use the files directly from their source without installing them to the target folder.

To enable this, run the application with the `static-content-source-folder` option and provide the full path to the frontend files location.

For example:
```-Dstatic-content-source-folder="/full/path/to/java-webapplication/src/main/resources/mdhtr/webapplication/public"```
